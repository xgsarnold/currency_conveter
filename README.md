# Currency Converter
#### These are the building blocks for a currency converter.
#### Each file contains a separate class necessary for
#### creating currency objects and passing in conversion rates.
#### The Currency Converter will enable you to add, subtract,
#### multiply, and compare currencies within the same currency
#### code. It will also allow you to convert a currency amount to
#### another if they are USD, GBP, EUR, or JPY. Moreover, the rates
#### of exchange can be updated each day by passing in new rates.
